## 1.1.1 Expressions

```scheme
(+ 137 349)
486
(- 1000 334)
666
(* 5 99)
495
(/ 10 5)
2
(+ 2.7 10)
12.7
```

Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of expressions within ***parentheses*** in order to denote procedure application, are called ***combinations***. 

The leftmost element in the list is called the ***operator***, and the other elements are called ***operands***.

- combinations：组合式，像上面的这个代码中的整个的`(- 1000 334)`，即由parentheses和operator和operator组成的就是combinations。

- operator：运算符
- operands：运算对象



```scheme
(+ 21 35 12 7)
75

(* 25 4 12)
1200
```

The convention of placing the operator to the left of the operands is known as ***prefix notation***.

- prefix notation（前缀表示）
  - it can accommodate procedures that may take an arbitrary number of arguments.
  - A second advantage of prefix notation is that it extends in a straightforward way to allow combinations to be *nested*（嵌套）.



## 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment

```scheme
(define pi 3.14159)
(define radius 10)
(* pi (* radius radius))
314.159
(define circumference (* 2 pi radius))
circumference
62.8318
```

We use key word `define` to refer to computational objects.`Define` is our language's simplest means of abstraction, for it allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations, such as the `circumference`computed above.

It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with symbols and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs. This memory is called the ***environment*** (more precisely the ***global environment***, since we will see later that a computation may involve a number of different environments).
